  </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg minced beef</li>
        <li>300g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>140g extra-mature or mature cheddar , grated</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 small bunch parsley </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble the mince in a large bowl, then tip in the breadcrumbs, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and eggs with 1 tsp ground pepper and 1-2 tsp salt. Mix with your hands to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Shape the mix into 12 burgers. Chill until ready to cook for up to 24 hrs. Or freeze for up to 3 months. Just stack between squares of baking parchment to stop the burgers sticking together, then wrap well. Defrost overnight in the fridge before cooking.</li>
        <li>To cook the burgers, heat grill to high. Grill burgers for 6-8 mins on each side until cooked through. Meanwhile, warm as many buns as you need in a foil-covered tray below the grilling burgers. Let everyone assemble their own, served with their favourite accompaniments. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
